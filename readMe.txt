Federico Vivaldo web development technologies 
this my idea of website implementation there are several technologies used.

Bootstrap: is used for the grid layout and some small features such as the inputgroup, Bootstrap svg icons are also used.

Jquery: is used togheter with javascript to provide interactions for the user

chart.js plugin: is used to provide charts and chart interactivity for the data supplied from the api

list-nav plugin: is used in university page to provide a letters filter for all the users who don't want to use the search input facility provided

the entire website is customised with a css style sheet that also provide a responsive layout for large medium and small screen sizes.

On the university page link to each uni are embeded to each name, this has been highlited with an hover effect to make the user concius that each name is clickable.

All the website images were taken from:
