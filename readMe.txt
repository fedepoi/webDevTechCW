Federico Vivaldo web development technologies 
this my idea of website implementation there are several technologies used.

Bootstrap: is used for the grid layout and some small features such as the inputgroup, Bootstrap svg icons are also used.

Jquery: is used togheter with javascript to provide interactions for the user

chart.js plugin: is used to provide charts and chart interactivity for the data supplied from the api

list-nav plugin: is used in university page to provide a letters filter for all the users who don't want to use the search input facility provided

the entire website is customised with a css style sheet that also provide a responsive layout for large medium and small screen sizes.
